# PyBer_Analysis
Analyzing PyBer Data

## Overview of Analysis

The purpose of this project is as follows:
-	Run a new PyBer analysis and describe the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types. The ride-sharing data to be explored include the total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride and driver, and total fare by city type
-	To submit a written report summarizing three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types 

## Results

### Total rides for each city type
-	Urban city type has the most rides with 1625 rides, followed by the suburban city type with 625 ride and rural city type has the least number of rides with 125 rides.

### Total drivers for each city type
-	Urban city type has the most total number of drivers with 2405 drivers, followed by the suburban city type with 490 drivers and rural city type has the least number of drivers with 78 drivers.

### Total amount of fares for each city type
-	The largest amount of fares was made in the urban city type with $39,854.38, followed by the suburban city type with $19,356.33 and rural city type has the least amount of fares with $4327.93

### Average fare per ride for each city type.
-	The average fare per ride for the urban city type is $24.53. The average fare per ride for the suburban city type is $30.97, and the average fare per ride for the rural city type is $34.62. 

### Average fare per driver for each city type.
-	The average fare per driver for the urban city type is $16.57. The average fare per ride for the suburban city type is $39.50, and the average fare per ride for the rural city type is $55.49. 

## Summary
This new analysis explores the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types. Specifically, these differences were explored on different city types per total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride and driver, and total fare by city type. The results show that the different city types are in fact different based on these factors. The urban city type has more rides, more drivers and more total fare than the suburban and the rural city types. Conversely, the average fares per ride and per driver of the rural city type are greater than those of the urban and suburban city types.

### The following are recommended based on the results of this new analysis:
1.	Drivers in the urban and suburban city types locations should be made aware of the opportunities (i.e., higher average fares per ride and per driver) in the rural city type locations. This will likely result in a win-win for the company (more rides in rural city type location, resulting in more fares) and for these drivers (high average fares resulting in increased income).
2.	The multiple-line graph created that shows the total weekly fares for each city type indicates that more total fare are made in all city types locations in the last week of February and first week in march. This shows that there are more riders during this period hence, the company can initiate a marketing promotion to encourage more riders, which in turn will increase total rides and total amount of fares.
3.	Currently, the rural city type locations have the least count of total rides, hence, resulting in the least amount of total fares. The company should put more effort towards encouraging more drivers and riders in rural city type locations (i.e., via sales promotion and other incentives) to increase total rides and total amount of fares.
